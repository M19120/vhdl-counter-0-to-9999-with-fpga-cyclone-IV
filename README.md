  Inside vhdl, counters are used to learn conditionals and events. A counter in vhdl can show us electronic events such as impulses,
  in each impulse, your system can going forward, it will depend about your clock configuration, if you´re using 7 segments display, etc. 

# Finite State Machines 
  A Finite State Machine, or FSM, is a computation model that can be used to simulate sequential logic, or, in other words, to represent and control execution flow. Finite State Machines can be used to model problems in many fields, including mathematics, artificial intelligence, games or linguistics. Inside vhdl it´s neccesary to make every event come true and later pass to the next

# Cyclone IV development board
This development board is cheap, reliable and easy to use. It has a 50 MHz clock, 7 segments display with 4 digits, 1 port RS232 to stablish comunicattion between anothers FPGA, MCU or MPU and other to create Video Audio applications.
